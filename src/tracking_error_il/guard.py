"""The jaw guard: bus-observable runtime force cap for any policy or expert.

Detector history (each mode cost a GPU eval before Rule 1 existed; the
engineered answer -- seat by stall, hold by position offset -- is standard
industrial gripper practice, cf. Robotiq object-detection at boot):

- slew mode: comparing measured motion against COMMANDED travel
  false-positives when commands outrun the servo slew limit;
- jitter mode: single-step extrapolation lets sub-count closing jitter
  against the deadband read as a stall;
- onset/backlash mode: the servo takes 2-4 steps to start following a new
  close (longer after direction reversals);
- creep-tracking miss: a slow close (the cloned guarded-move, ~4 counts per
  step) tracks the command INTO the object with no kinematic stall until
  deep in the squeeze -- contact appears instead as gap in excess of the
  rate-proportional following lag.

The v3 detector: (net-travel stall OR lag-excess contact), sustained
``persist`` consecutive steps. Validated offline on 12 instrumented episodes
of the scaled 224px policy: 0 phantoms, 0 misses, force-at-seat median 37 N
max 49 N against raw peaks of 90-156 N.
