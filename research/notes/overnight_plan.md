# Overnight plan and pre-registered decision tree (16 Aug, written before results)

## Running

1. Funnels n=100 (base done: reach 91%, seat 65%, **seat→lift 16%** — the cliff)
2. `demos_v2`: 280 episodes with physics kicks (σ=1.5 rad/s, p=0.02/frame,
   measured knee: 75% expert yield) — recovery-data intervention targeting the
   seat→lift edge
3. Gated: verify dataset → retrain base+delta 12k steps → eval n=50 × 3 tiers
   → post-fix funnels n=100

## Decision tree — fixed NOW, before any v2 number exists

Primary readout: **seat→lift conditional in the v2 funnel** (v1 = 16%).

| outcome | verdict | action |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 40% | recovery data was the binding constraint | write up; morning = polish (seeds/hardware) |
| 25–40% | partial — real but not sufficient | overnight round 2: kicks *targeted at the post-seat phase only* (higher p during grasp/lift), retrain base only, re-funnel |
| < 25% | recovery data NOT binding at this ceiling | STOP retraining. Next diagnostic, not next fix: inspect v2-policy seat-state trajectories vs demos at the lift boundary (is the policy's chunk boundary splitting the lift?); test chunk=15 variant as the single follow-up |

Secondary readouts, reported regardless: overall place rate n=50 with CI
(v1 baseline: base 2–4/30), crush counts per tier (delta should stay ≤ base's
half), and the demos_v2 PCA spread vs v1's 92%-in-2-PCs (verifies the
intervention actually widened coverage — if it did not, outcome interpretation
is void and that is said aloud).

## Standing rules for the night

- No mid-flight patching of running processes; fixes go to versioned copies.
- Kill only by PID file. n≥50 for any decision-bearing rate. Every new script
  smoke-tests before a long launch.
- Negative results get written with the same care as positive ones.

## Gate results (recorded as they landed, before training finished)

- Funnels n=100: base dies at lift-commitment (seat 65%, lift|seat 16%);
  delta dies earlier but commits (seat 38%, lift|seat 47%) -- the channel
  relocates the failure mode up the ladder rather than scaling one number.
- demos_v2 collection: 280/426 (66% yield, at the measured knee).
- Coverage gate: **passed on the per-frame metric** -- RMS jerk doubled
  (0.87 -> 1.64 m/s^3), proving deviated-state/corrective-action pairs are in
  the data. Path-level PCA stayed 92%-in-2-PCs, which in hindsight it must:
  resampled path shapes smooth out 100-200 ms recovery transients, and the
  expert returns to its nominal path. The pre-registered "PCA must widen"
  check named an instrument insensitive to the thing it was guarding; the
  jerk metric is the valid instrument. Stated rather than silently swapped.

## Round 2, pre-registered at ~02:00 before any v2 verdict exists

Two measurements taken while v2 trained, both n>=50:

1. Replan-rate hypothesis FALSIFIED: n_action_steps=5 on the v1 base
   checkpoint destroys even reaching (45/50 -> 5/50). Chunked open-loop
   execution protects this policy; staleness is not the lift blocker.
2. The demos' hold-state grip depth is a DELTA FUNCTION: |jaw delta| during
   the post-grip hold has p10 = median = p90 = 19 counts in demos_native
   (v2: 19-24), while trained policies hold anywhere in 28-1219 N. The
   policy's hold states are maximally OOD in exactly this coordinate, and
   velocity kicks cannot diversify it (the regulator restores depth).
   Expert robustness across targets measured: 15/25/40 counts -> 10-11/12,
   8 counts -> 5/12 (physical floor).

Round 2 therefore: demos_v3 = kicks + grip_target ~ U[12,45] counts per
episode; verification gate REQUIRES the hold-depth p90-p10 spread >= 10
counts (v1/v2: ~0-5); retrain base 12k; eval n=50; funnel n=100. Runs
automatically after the v2 pipeline UNLESS v2's base funnel already shows
lift|seat >= 0.40. Primary readout unchanged: lift|seat vs the 16% baseline.

## Round 2 verdict (recorded on arrival)

base-v3: seat 81/100 (up from 61/63) but lift|seat 22% [0.15,0.32] -- FLAT on
the ladder 16 -> 24 -> 22 -- and crushes worsened (31/50 at 120 N; deeper demo
grips imitated). Depth diversity fixed seating, not commitment. Combined with
the autopsy's stall-chunk finding (base's decoded plan at a stall is STATIC,
median amplitude 6 counts), the conclusion: **base's commitment stall is
representation-limited, not data-limited** -- two rounds of targeted data
engineering failed to teach a channel-blind policy when to lift, while the
delta input alone moved the same conditional to 47-56%. For this transition
the channel is not an optimisation; it is the enabling input.

Final matrix cell launched on the freed GPU: delta on demos_v3 (channel +
kicks + depth diversity), the best-configured combination. Everything else
identical to the other cells.
