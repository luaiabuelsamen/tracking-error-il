"""Pre-registered analysis of the B2 and G cells.

WRITTEN BEFORE THE THIRD SEED EXISTED. At authoring time two B2 seeds had
completed and no G seed had. The point of writing it now is that the comparison,
the interval method and the decision rule are fixed before the data can
influence them; running it later then has no degrees of freedom left.

Decision rule, frozen in research/notes/task2_arms.md before the cells launched:
claim a difference only at >= 15 points. sigma_seed on this grid is ~10 and
E's own five seeds span 17-36, so smaller gaps are not resolvable at n=3.

Readings, also frozen before the cells ran:

  E >= B2   strong evidence for the free-motion subtraction. B2 is
            information-matched to E -- both see s[t], a[t-1], a[t-2] -- so a
            gap cannot be the extra action frame and must be the form.
  E <  B2   AMBIGUOUS, and must not be reported as a clean negative. B2 is
            18-dim against E's 12, so raw two-frame access winning and extra
            observation width helping are not separable by this cell.

  E vs G    G is [s[t], s[t-8]], width-matched to E at 12 dims but carrying
            position history instead of the channel. E > G is evidence the
            channel is not substitutable by joint history. G bounds the
            long-context alternative of zeng2026revisiting; it does not
            settle it, since G is one frame at lag 8 and their effect is
            T_o = 12-20.

Intervals are the paper's two-level bootstrap: resample seeds, then redraw each
resampled seed's success count from Binomial(100, p_hat). Seed-only resampling
understates width by 2.2-2.6 points on this grid and would overstate precision.
