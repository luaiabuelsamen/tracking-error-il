"""Check the paper's load-bearing numbers against the frozen result files.

Twice in one day the paper stated a number the data did not support: the guard
paragraph said "one policy" where the result was every policy, and a crush count
over 180 episodes was quoted beside a force range over 270. Both were recorded in
docs/findings.md and neither reached main.tex. The failure mode is the paper
drifting from data that a script already reproduces, so this is that script.

It recomputes each claim from results/ and asserts the value appears in the
paper. It is deliberately literal: it does not parse LaTeX, it checks that the
rendered number is present, which is enough to catch a stale edit and cheap
enough to run on every build.

    python scripts/check_paper_numbers.py          # exits non-zero on drift
